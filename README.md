## Answers of ap csa free response questions
I'm currently working on AP test, and feel like uploading my answers here a good choice :)<br/>
This is the answers for AP Computer Science A Free Response Questions from 2004 to 2019 written by me.<br/>
## Notice:
The answers here have all been tested if possible, and if not, it will be indicated in the file.<br/>
All the methods required to write are written within the AP requirements, so there may be some better approaches using methods that are not included in AP CSA curriculum.<br/>
Some questions that are no longer tested are not done in this project.
List object is no longer tested, so all the List are replaced by ArrayList.
